## Overview
Welcome to the RSS Feed Aggregator project in Go! In this project, we'll be building a web server that allows users to manage and follow RSS feeds. You can use this aggregator to keep track of updates from your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more.

## What Are We Building?
We're creating a web server that enables clients to:

Add RSS feeds for collection\
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds added by other users\
- Fetch the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow\
- RSS feeds are a standardized way for websites to publish updates to their content, making it easy for users to stay informed about the latest updates on their preferred websites.

## Goals
Integrate a Go server with PostgreSQL: Connect Go application to a PostgreSQL database, enabling data storage and retrieval

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the RSS Feed Aggregator project:\
Configure your PostgreSQL database connection in the config file.
```
git clone https://github.com/c1kzy/BlogAggregator.git
go run main.go
```
Feel free to explore the codebase and modify it according to your needs. Happy coding!
